## Program that determines whether there is a protein in a strand of DNA.

A protein has the following qualities:

It begins with a “start codon”: ATG.
It ends with a “stop codon”: TGA.
In between, each additional codon is a sequence of three nucleotides.
So for example:

ATGCGATACTGA is a protein because it has the start codon ATG, the stop codon TGA, and the length is divisible by 3.
ATGCGATAGA is not a protein because the sequence length is not divisible by 3, so the third condition is not satisfied.
